# [DayZ-SA.cz](https://dayz-sa.cz/)'s Event Viewer Tool
> Version v1.2


## Introduction

![Preview image](readme-images/Preview.png)

This tool utilizes [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com) library to deliver interactive event visualization parsed from server log files.
By default it uses map data from [iZurvive](https://izurvive.com) (but you can easily provide your own).
It can be either invaluable admin tool or public showcase of interesting events.

However, this app does not provide all the required functionality on its own as logs provided by vanilla DayZ servers do not contain necessary information.
This can only be solved by using a mod for the server implementing required functionality.

Almost any behaviour of this tool can be configured from config files.
Read more about them in README file located in `config` directory.

**This application is not fool-proof! Invalid configuration may cause unexpected behaviour.**
